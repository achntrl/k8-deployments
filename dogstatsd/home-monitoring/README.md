# Temperature and humidity monitoring

I bought a couple of ESP 8266 modules with DHT 22 sensors. I can measure humidity and temperature
in my room with it.

One can program on the ESP 8266 with the Arduino IDE. See [here](https://www.instructables.com/id/Setting-Up-the-Arduino-IDE-to-Program-the-ESP8266-/)
